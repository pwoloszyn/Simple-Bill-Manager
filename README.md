2. Details of use:

 The way the user would use this application would be by first setting up a list of bills that they would
 like to track, this is done by using the 'Add' button. The 'Add' button opens up a new 'Bill Editor Window' window which
 contains 4 text fields: 
 'Name' which designates the bill name, 
 'Day' which designates the billing day of the month,
 'Amount' which designates the payment amount for the previous bill, 
 and the 'Web Address' which would be the link to a website that the user would like to open upon pressing
 the 'Pay' button. 
 Only the two first text fields are required to add a new bill, the other two are optional.
 
 After a bill is added it should appear in the table of the bill manager. If the user is not satisfied with the
 bill info they can either deleted it by selecting it in the table and clicking on the 'Delete' button, or they
 can select it, click the 'Edit' button and change the bill info.
 
 The user can indicate that they have paid a bill by selecting a given bill in the table and typing the amount
 paid into the pop-up window, this will update the table and the billing history of the bill. As mentioned above,
 if the bill has a weblink added, clicking on the 'Pay' button will also open the primary browser at the designated
 address.
 
 The App also keeps track of whether the bills are due or overdue, this is indicated by the 'Due/Overdue' column
 in the table, if it states 'YES' then the bill is due/overdue otherwise it states 'NO'.
 
 The App also keeps track of payment history which can be accessed by selecting a bill in the table
 and clicking on the 'History' button, this will open up a new window with the history of payments displayed.
